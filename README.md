# Encryption Final Project – Caesar, Vigenère, and AES
**Author:** Raven Roberts  
**Course:** COM-501-MCS01  
**Instructor:** Dr. Stan Ustymenko  
**Date:** 10/19/2025

This repository contains Python implementations of three encryption methods:
1. **Caesar Cipher**
2. **Vigenère Cipher**
3. **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**

Each script demonstrates both encryption and decryption and verifies that the decrypted text matches the original.

### Files
- `caesar_vigenere.py` – Implements Caesar and Vigenère ciphers
- `aes_encryption.py` – Implements AES-256 encryption/decryption
- `passwords.txt` – Example plaintext file (upload a small dummy text)
- `README.md` – Project overview

### Instructions
You can view the code directly on GitHub.  
Each file can be run in a Python environment to demonstrate encryption and decryption.

This project fulfills the Module 8 Final Project requirement for explaining, designing algorithms, pseudocode, and Python implementation for three encryption methods.
